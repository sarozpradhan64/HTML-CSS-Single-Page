          southeast of Nepal (the standard route) and the other from the north in Tibet.Climbing Everest possesses lots
          of risks such as altitude sickness. Moreover there is higher risks with exposure to dangerous weather, and
          high winds. Avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall’s crevasse are a constant threat to life as well.As of 2019,
          over 300 people have died on Everest (as of 2019).The bodies of many climbers who have died on Everest have
          never been found.

          The second highest mountain of Nepal and the world’s third-highest ‘Kanchenjunga’ lies in the Taplejung
          District, Province No. 1. It has a height of 8,586 meters (28,169 ft) and is also known as ‘the five treasures
          of snow’ as it consists of five prominent peaks. Joe Brown and George Band first summited it in 1955.

          Kanchenjunga was believed to be the highest peak, but later, in 1856, it was officially announced as the
          world’s third highest. It consists of four climbing routes, three of which are in Nepal, and one is from
          Sikkim in India. The route to Kanchenjunga from Sikkim has remained closed from 2000.
